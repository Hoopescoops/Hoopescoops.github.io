                            The arduous processes in my practice exist as exercises in meditation and worship. 
                            I am worshipping through the action of craft similar to monks who have produced 
                            sand mandalas and stained glass windows in the proclamation of their faith. 
                            My work aims to engage with the viewer so that they may interact with it and upon 
                            closer inspection can begin to decipher the methods by which it was made. 
                            I imagine that the exertion of energy in combination with intention and curiosity 
                            fosters the birthing of each itemâ€™s soul. I adore the stories that objects may tell us, 
                            simply by allowing the item to speak for itself through its physical attributes. 
                            Materials such as Metal, Glass, and Clay are all known for possessing shape memory, 
                            which can reflect the order of actions conducted upon them. 
                            Every little bit of ornamentation imbues each object with more personality which it will 
                            bear for the rest of existence. As an artist and craftsperson, I am honored to celebrate 
                            art history by learning old techniques and blending them with contemporary practices to 
                            create new artifacts with a unique personality to this epoch.
